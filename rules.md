# X-Team 118 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will have weekly meetings on Mondays that assess the work to be done for the coming week.
It is there that we will breakdown problems that must be solved and assign smaller tasks to each individual member.
Should a members work need to be reassigned, we will act accordingly.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will maintain stronger communication through the use of a groupchat and an associated google doc which logs all tasks and assignments.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Keep everyone up to date. Members should feel free to reach out via any of the aforementioned channels of communication.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will hold eachother accountable-- everyone understands that we have a job to do and everyone's success depends on one another.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Update one another once anyone makes any changes to a remote repository. Report any progress made on any group assignment.
Ensure that we transition into the norming stage of team development.
